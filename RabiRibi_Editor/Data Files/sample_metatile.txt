# Sample metatile file
#
# Note: any blank lines or lines starting with "#" are ignored by the program.
#
# Each metatile is divided into a 3 by 3 grid of rectangles, something like
# the following:
#
# upper-left       upper-mid       upper-right
# mid-left         mid-mid         mid-right
# lower-left       lower-mid       lower-right
#
# The upper, lower, left, and right parts define the borders, while the mid
# parts define the middle, which can repeat depending on how big the user
# draws the metatile.
#
# To define a metatile, first give it a name with a line like this (without
# the "#"):
# metatile My Custom Metatile
#
# Next, the size of the sections must be defined.  This is done by specifying
# the top/mid/bottom number of rows, and left/mid/right number of columns:
# top_rows 1
# mid_rows 2
# bottom_rows 3
# left_cols 2
# mid_cols 3
# right_cols 1
#
# You can have zero top/bottom rows or left/right columns, but you must have at
# least one mid row/column.
#
# You can optionally define a slope as well.  If set to non-zero, the top of
# the metatile will shift vertically by this amount each horizontal repeat of
# the mid columns.  This allows creation of sloped surfaces.
# Note that negative values slope downward to the right, while positive values
# slope downward to the left.
# slope 1
#
# Finally, the actual tile updates need to be defined.  This takes the form of
# one or more layer statements, followed by the tile values to use:
# layer 1
# 1 2 3 4 5 6h
# 2 3 4 5 6 7v
# 3 4 5 6 7 8hv
# 4 5 6 7 8 9
# 5 6 7 8 9 1
# 6 5 4 3 2 1
#
# (Note: the tile values don't need to be arranged by rows and columns, but it's
# probably a good idea to help align things when making metatile definitions)
#
# The 'layer' command is followed by one of the following:
# 0 through 6 - draw on this tile layer
# S - draw on the user-selected tile layer
# C - draw on the collision layer (uses collision tile values)
# E - draw on the event layer (event IDs)
# I - draw on the item layer (item IDs)
#
# For tile layers only, 'h' and 'v' can be added to number to specify
# horizontal and/or vertical flip.
#
# Once all of the layers for a metatile are defined, another metatile can be
# started by starting from the 'metatile' command again.
